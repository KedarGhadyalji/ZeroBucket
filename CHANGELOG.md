# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- `put(optimize=True, max_width=, format=, quality=)`: opt-in image
  optimization -- metadata stripping (EXIF/GPS/ICC), resizing (LANCZOS),
  and quality-based JPEG/WebP re-encoding.
- Quality defaults (JPEG=90, WebP=88) are backed by measured SSIM data
  across multiple content types, not guessed -- see
  `benchmarks/COMPRESSION_RESULTS.md`.
- `OptimizationResult` type, exported from the package root.

### Findings worth knowing about

- Re-encoding flat/graphic content (screenshots, logos) as JPEG can make
  it _larger_, not smaller -- confirmed by measurement, documented in
  `COMPRESSION_RESULTS.md`. Use PNG or WebP for that content instead.
- "Visually lossless" is content-dependent, not just quality-setting
  dependent: dense fine-texture images (foliage, fabric) have a lower
  achievable SSIM ceiling than smooth photos, regardless of quality.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- `PostgresBackend` now closes its connection pool cleanly when setup
  fails (e.g. bad credentials), instead of leaking background worker
  threads.
- Connection acquisition timeout reduced from 30s to 10s, so
  misconfiguration surfaces faster.

### Changed

- Expanded PyPI package README with full API reference and usage
  examples (previously a placeholder).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Initial release: `put`, `get`, `metadata`, `exists`, `delete`.
- PostgreSQL storage adapter (BYTEA-backed).
- Content-based image validation: format sniffing, size limits,
  decompression-bomb protection, corruption detection.
- Test suite (30 tests) covering validation, client behavior, and error
  handling against a real PostgreSQL instance.
