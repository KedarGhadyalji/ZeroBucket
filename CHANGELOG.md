# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- `PostgresBackend` now closes its connection pool cleanly when setup
  fails (e.g. bad credentials), instead of leaking background worker
  threads.
- Connection acquisition timeout reduced from 30s to 10s, so
  misconfiguration surfaces faster.

### Changed

- Expanded PyPI package README with full API reference and usage
  examples (previously a placeholder).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Initial release: `put`, `get`, `metadata`, `exists`, `delete`.
- PostgreSQL storage adapter (BYTEA-backed).
- Content-based image validation: format sniffing, size limits,
  decompression-bomb protection, corruption detection.
- Test suite (30 tests) covering validation, client behavior, and error
  handling against a real PostgreSQL instance.
